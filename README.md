# Project to improve my typing speed on TypeRacer

Improving my typing speed has been my latest interest, but practicing it takes a lot of time and willpower. I've been writing small scripts to automate games and free up my free time spent playing them throughout the past couple of years. TypeRacer is also sort of a game, so why shouldn't I write a script that practices instead of me? My current typing speed is **_too fast_** (according to TypeRacer).

## How to use it

1. Open the TypeRacer website
2. Run main.py in a terminal
3. Start a race on TypeRacer and wait for your opponents to join
4. Select the bounding box of the text you should type
    1. Move the cursor to the top-left corner of the text and press Ctrl
    2. Move the mouse to the bottom-right corner of the text and press Ctrl again

If you succeeded, then the script should automatically start typing for you!

The upper limit of the typing speed can be changed with the DESIRED_WPM variable inside the script.
