# Project to improve my typing speed on TypeRacer

Improving my typing speed has been my latest interest, but practicing it takes a lot of time and willpower. I've been writing small scripts to automate games and free up my free time spent playing them throughout the past couple of years. TypeRacer is also sort of a game, so why shouldn't I write a script that practices instead of me?

## How to use it

Open the TypeRacer website
Start the script in a terminal
Start a race on TypeRacer and wait for your opponents to join
Select the bounding box of the text you should type
Move the cursor to the top-left corner of the text and press Ctrl
Move the mouse to the bottom-right corner of the text and press Ctrl again
If you succeeded, then the script should automatically start typing for you

The upper limit of the typing speed can be changed with the DESIRED_WPM variable inside the script.
